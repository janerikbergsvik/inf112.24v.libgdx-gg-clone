## Welcome to Simplest Jekyll demo

Welcome to the page about Echoing dreams

What is it?

Echoing dreams is a Great Giana Sisters inspired 2d game developed during spring semester 2024 in the
subject INF112 - Systems Engineering at the University of Bergen. The original game was developed for
the Commodore 64 platform and developers have many good memories of this.

Who made it?

It is developed by DIGI-teamet consisting of the following team members:

Endre Haaland Jorgensen
Jan Erik Bergsvik
Kristoffer Soerensen Vestboe
Tanja Todorovic

What does it look like?

Inside the game

A gameplay hint
The game can be quite difficult to complete. If you want to get off to a good start, then
you should initiate the cheat code which is readily activated by holding "DIGI" keys down
at the same time. This will grant you extra time, lives, health and activate the shooting power-up
immediately.

If you want to skip to the next level, then you can just press "n" for next level.

Did we do it all ourselves?
A big thank you to Anya Helene Bagge for giving us the opportunity to develop the game as part of the subject.
And especically thanks to Brent Aureli (https://www.youtube.com/@BrentAureliCodes) and more specifically his 
Mario tutorials which have been used as guidance through-out the project.

Thanks for all your your interest.

Please let me know if any issues arise, I can be contacted at bergsvik@alumni.ntnu.no.
